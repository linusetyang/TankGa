## CSC 413(Software Development)- Final Project game #1(Tank Game)

### Student Name : 

### IDE Used: IntelliJ IDEA
### Version of Java: 16.0.2

***Note on Documentation: Please note that the documentation for this game is included within the repo, and the documentation 
  goes into great detail in explaining both parts of my Final Project(both the Tank Game)***


 **How to import the game:**
 
   1. Go to the "Project Structure" menu within IntelliJ and select the following:
   
      - Set the Github repo("csc413-tankgame") as the content root
      - Set "src" folder as a source folder
      - Set the "src/resources" folder as a resource folder 
     
 **How to run the game:**
 1. The easiest way to run the game is to simply copy the jar file("csc413-tankgame.jar") found in the /jar folder.
 2. Execute the jar file by either:
 
    - double clicking file.
    -  by using the command line(something similar to Windows PowerShell). Please note
    that you will need to have Java installed in order to run the game. 
    
 **Controls:**
   - **NOTE**: The controls will be listed below, BUT please note that they can also be accessed in the Main Menu of the game by pressing the "HELP" button.
    I personally feel that the controls are easier to follow in the help screen, because their layout is shown in a visual and color-coded fashion.
    
   ---- Player1 controls ----
   - W: Move Forwards
   - A: Rotate left
   - S: Move Backwards
   - D: Rotate right
   - Q: Shoot
    
    
   ---- Player2 controls -----
   - UP key: Move Forwards
   - LEFT key: Rotate Left
   - DOWN key: Move Backwards
   - RIGHT key: Rotate Right  
   - ENTER key: Shoot
    
 **How to play the game:**
    
   - **NOTE**: a brief version of how to play the game can also be found within the HELP screen of the main menu.



   - The purpose of Tank Wars is for two players to fight till the end. A player emerges as victorious when the lives of their opponent have run out.
   - Each player has 2 lives, and will respawn until they have no more lives(at which point the game is over). 
   - PowerUps can be found within the eyes and mouth of the humanoid wall structure which is at the center of the map.
   - There are two types of walls(breakable and unbreakable); all walls not surrounding the entire game map are breakable and will destruct when shot by 2 bullets.
   - There are 2 types of PowerUps: SpeedBoost and Health; the SpeedBoost PowerUp will boost a player's speed for a total of 5 seconds while the Health PowerUp will 
     fully replenish a player's health.
